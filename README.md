# Usage

## Beginner/Basic

```ts
import { Client } from 'gupi';

new Client({ email: 'emailhere', password: 'passwordhere' })
  .on('ready', () => console.log('Successfully connected to gateway'))
  .on('messageCreate', message => {
    if (message.content === '!ping') {
      // TODO: pending
    }
  })
  .on('unknown', console.log)
  .connect();
```

## BotClient (Full Command Framework)

```ts
// index.ts
import { BotClient } from 'gupi';
import configs from './configs';

// Start it up!
const client = new BotClient(configs).on('ready', () => console.log('Successfully connected to gateway')).connect();

// src/commands/avatar.ts
import { Command, CommandArgument, Message, User, Embed } from 'gupi';

export default class extends Command {
  name = 'avatar';
  aliases = ['pfp'];
  description = 'üñºÔ∏è View the avatar image for a user or the server.';
  arguments = [
    { name: 'server', type: 'string', literals: ['server'], required: false },
    { name: 'user', type: 'user', required: false },
  ] as CommandArgument[];

  async execute(message: Message, args: { user?: User; server?: 'server' }) {
    // BY DEFAULT WE USE THE USERS OWN URL
    let url = message.author.dynamicAvatarURL({ type: 'Large' });
    // IF THE USER WANTED THE SERVER AVATAR USE IT
    if (args.server && message.team) url = message.team.dynamicAvatarURL({ type: 'Large' });
    // IF A USER WAS REQUESTED, THEN WE USE THAT
    if (args.user) url = args.user.dynamicAvatarURL({ type: 'Large' });

    return message.send(
      new Embed()
        .setAuthor(message.author)
        .setDescription(`[${message.translate('commands/avatar:DOWNLOAD_LINK')}](${url})`)
        .setImage(url),
    );
  }
}
```

## Advanced Customizations

Everything below this is to showcase examples of advanced features! They are intentionally written in a way that is confusing to a beginner developer, as it is not meant for you. This is an extreme edge case scenario for bots that scale really big!

```ts
// Cache Control!
// Set to 0 to disable caching. Apply to any desired Collection.
client.users.maxSize = 1000;

client.connect();
```
