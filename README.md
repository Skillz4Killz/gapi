# gapi / gupi

A TypeScript NodeJS API Wrapper for Guilded.gg API.

> Currently unstable and in active dev. Use with caution.

> The name is gapi but silly google took that name so on npm we use gupi!

# Design Goals

- Best Scalability!
- Best developer experience!
- Extremely flexible/dynamic!
- Keep close to API as possible

# Usage

## Beginner/Basic

```ts
import { Client } from 'gupi';

const client = new Client({ email: 'emailhere', password: 'passwordhere' })
  .on('ready', () => console.log('Successfully connected to gateway'))
  .on('messageCreate', message => {
    if (message.content === '!ping') {
      // TODO: pending
    }
  })
  .connect();
```

## Advanced

```ts
import { Client, baseStructures, structures } from 'gupi';

// Override any internal structures without having to fork and maintain headaches.
baseStructures.Base = class {
  // Adding custom props
  newProp: 'success';
  // On the opposite side, use this to remove any props you don't want to save RAM/cache!

  // Adding custom getters
  get newGetter() {
    return true;
  }

  // Add custom methods
  newMethod() {
    return true;
  }
};

// Most commonly used structures
structures.Message = class extends baseStructures.Base {
  // Same as above. Everything is customizable
};

// Start it up!
const client = new Client({ email: 'emailhere', password: 'passwordhere' })
  .on('ready', () => console.log('Successfully connected to gateway'))
  .on('messageCreate', message => {
    if (message.content === '!ping') {
      // TODO: pending
    }
  });

// Cache Control!
// Set to 0 to disable caching. Apply to any desired Collection.
client.users.maxSize = 1000;

client.connect();
```
